# NeutrinoPhysics

Welcome to the **NeutrinoPhysics** repository! This repository contains Python scripts and associated code to generate plots related to neutrino oscillations and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect. The focus is on modeling two-flavor and three-flavor neutrino oscillations, as well as visualizing the MSW effect with respect to the mixing angle parameter $\(\sin^2 2\theta\)$ and the matter potential term $\(2E V / \Delta m^2\)$.

## Overview

This repository includes the following key components:
- **Two-Flavour Oscillations**: Code to simulate and plot the oscillation probabilities for a two-flavor neutrino system $(\(\nu_e \leftrightarrow \nu_\mu\))$.
- **Three-Flavour Oscillations**: Code to model and visualize the more complex three-flavor neutrino system $(\(\nu_e\)$, $\(\nu_\mu\)$, $\(\nu_\tau\))$.
- **MSW Plot**: A plot of the effective mixing angle parameter $\(\sin^2 2\theta\)$ as a function of $\(2E V / \Delta m^2\)$, illustrating the resonance behavior in matter.

These scripts are developed using Python with libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy, providing a computational approach to explore neutrino physics phenomena.

## Requirements

To run the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Python** 3.7 or higher
- **NumPy** 1.17.2 or higher
- **Matplotlib** 3.1.1 or higher
- **SciPy** 1.3.1 or higher (optional, for numerical solutions)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
